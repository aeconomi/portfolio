                            <p>In order to keep up with technology, expectations, and competition in the marketplace, the Hertz.com Digital Transformation
                                endeavored to unify the disconnected legacy platforms and redesign the Hertz digital experience. The project used an agile
                                release process to deploy different sections of the website in order to launch more quickly and facilitate customer
                                feedback/customer-focused development. As one of the Content Leads, my role was to help migrate the 2,000+ pages (not including
                                translations) onto an up-to-date CMS platform, ensuring the content was brand approved and SEO optimized. A project of this
                                scale required input from many different departments. I collaborated with the IBM development, UX, and Marketing teams on a
                                day-to-day basis. </p>

                            <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
                            <p> Over the years, the legacy website had racked up a huge number of pages, many of which were old and outdated with irrelevant
                                content. In order to keep track of all the pages, we used Gather Content to organize sections of the site into different
                                “buckets”, (e.g. Location, Special Offer, Marketing Landing Pages). Google Analytics was a good starting point to know which
                                pages to include in the migration: </p> <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Pages with high amounts of traffic were automatically included.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Evergreen pages (content that is always relevant) or pages the company deemed essential (like FAQs, Partner pages, or
                                        pages required by Legal) were also important.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Pages with high bounce rates were reviewed for content restructuring and rewrites to be done by our SEO agency.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Pages with low amounts of traffic were reviewed for 301 redirects.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul> <br>
                            <p> We then went through each of the buckets with the appropriate stakeholders and our SEO agency to see which ones we needed to
                                keep, restructure, and remove. We also reviewed the content to determine if it was still relevant and whether or not the content
                                still matched the voice of the brand. I helped reorganize, rewrite, and restructure the content moving from the old site to the
                                new site. One of my responsibilities was to log and keep track of the pages that would be migrated, 301 redirected, and
                                rewritten for SEO optimization. </p>

                            <p> We used A/B testing and user feedback to iterate designs and make content updates as sections were released. In sessions using
                                Clicktale, our analytics team found that site structure and search functionality were a few of the biggest pain-points for
                                customers. We ended up shortening the titles on the main navigation, and adding search, chat, and contact information in the
                                header (under the search icon) to make it easier for customers to navigate the site. </p> <br>

                                <p>The new reservation flow rolled out to US and Canadian customers in early March, when covid-19 shutdowns began. The virus
                                    took a direct hit on the travel industry making it hard to measure the impact the redesign had on conversions and eCommerce
                                    revenue. However, we were able to measure page load speed right away, dropping from 6 seconds to 3-4 seconds- a 45%
                                    decrease.</p> <br>
                                <p> I really enjoyed being a part of each stage in the website migration and redesign- to be involved on the content side of
                                    developing and launching new features, gathering feedback, then making changes based on our findings. More often, the small
                                    changes had the biggest impact. Removing unnecessary steps and content from the checkout process was a primary driver in
                                    increased conversion rates. </p> <br>
                                <p> Creating consistent page templates and a single design system is vital for a unified brand experience, as we learned, but
                                    it's also important to build templates and components that allow for as much flexibility as possible as priorities and
                                    marketing initiatives change over time. More often, the small changes had the biggest impact. Removing unnecessary steps and
                                    content from the checkout process was a primary driver in increased conversion rates. </p> <br>
