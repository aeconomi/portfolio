                        <p>The Marketing team was in charge of developing an activation strategy to promote new vehicles that were added to the fleet. With the acquistion of BMW X3's, the Dollar brand team discovered a high search volume around BMW rentals. The Dollar brand team planned to create click-through ads and email marketing campaigns to promote the new BMW X3's. The Dollar website did not have much content on BMW's, and the vehicle pages in general did not contain much imagery, copy, or enticing text.

                           The Dollar website was an extremely old site hosted on legacy platforms. The IT team was small and 
                           mainly worked on system updates to keep the website from crashing. The CMS platform was also very 
                           dated and our team was restricted to editing the body html. Since the plan was to move to a new 
                           platform altogther, we did what we could from the front-end to make the content as visually pleasing 
                           as possible until we migrated the website to the new platform.

                      <p>While I did not keep a screenshot of the Prestige page before the revamp, I took a screenshot of the SUV page 
                         which was built using the exact same layout and will give you an idea of the before and after that took place (pictured below).</p>

                           <p>I was asked to create the pre-cart landing page where customers could land after they'd 
                              clicked on an ad to rent the new BMW's. Instead of building a one-off page that would only 
                              live the length of the campaign, we decided to do a full content overhaul of our Prestige 
                              Collection page which included the BMW's. The plan was to reuse this
                                new template to build out the other car collection pages to provide customers with better 
                                information and imagery about the Dollar fleet. We worked with the Dollar Brand team on copy and imagery to put the below layout together. Once the design was ready I began development.</p>

                  After the revamp, the number of transactions from the Prestige Collection page was 127% higher than transactions on other Collection pages (like the Luxury Collection page). Conversion rate was also 35% higher.

                     A big focus on this project was shortening the ecommerce path to purchase. If customers found a specific car they wanted to rent, we needed a way for customers to go directly to the booking funnel with their selected car included in their reservation. We worked with our IT team to set up URL parameters that would preselect a certain car class in the booking flow depending on the SIPP code (code that stands for the major features of a car rental) that was embedded in the CTA button URL. This kept customers focued on their purchase.

                  <br>
                  <p>One of the challenges ont his project was that our team only had access to the body html in the CMS platform so we could not edit things like the main navigation or footer. We also could not update the body container to expand to it's full-width as these CSS rules were in a stylesheet we did not have access to. Were were however able to update the everything between the body tags, so we wanted to optimize the content area as much as possible.</p>
